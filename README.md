An app made with ❤️ to demonstrate some examples of **clean architecture**, **code organisation**, **loose coupling**, **unit testing** and some of the best practices used in modern iOS programming using latest `Swift 5.0.1` and its latest power tools like `Combine` and some of the `SwiftUI` magic.
